# Lab 3: Lookback Option & Markov based computationally efficient Binomial algorithm

* The price of lookback option is calculated using Binomial algorithm, and analysis is performed on the criteria like computational time, the value of M it can handle, etc.

* The naive algorithm is then improved using Markov based techniques, and the improvements in various parameters is analysed.
